# Untitled Word Game
Welcome to UWD, a quick game I made because I had no one to play with ðŸ˜¢ </br>
You also need to download wordlist and have it in the same folder 
## How to play
- A player starts by saying a letter
- The other played says a word that starts with that letter
- The next word starts with the letter of the last word
## Rules
- You cannot say a word that has been already said
- The word must start with the letter of the last one
## Example
Player 1: a </br>
Player 2: amazing </br>
Player 1: green </br>
Player 2: niece  </br>
And so on
# Reasons for and End Screen
- Already used word
- Not a real word
- Doesn't start with the letter of the last word
# Have fun ðŸ˜„
